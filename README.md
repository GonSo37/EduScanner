# Edu Scanner
  This is a web application built with ASP.NET MVC that helps display all lectures from existing subjects along with their respective lecturers . 
  If a subject does not have any lectures scheduled, the application will display the next most relevant session type, such as ćwiczenia, laboratorium, or projekt, depending on the available information.

  Additionally, the application supports updating the displayed information by performing web scraping of the university's schedule website when necessary.
